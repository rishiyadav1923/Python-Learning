# Python cmath.phase() Method

# Example
# Find the phase of a complex number:

#Import cmath Library
import cmath

#print phase of some given parameters
print (cmath.phase(2 + 3j))

# Definition and Usage
# The cmath.phase() method returns the phase of a complex number.
# A complx number can be expressed in terms of its magnitude and angle. This angle is between vector (representing complex number) and positive x-axis is called Phase.

# *Note: Output is always between -π and π.

# Syntax
# cmath.phase(x)

# Parameter Values
# Parameter	                Description
# x	                        Required. The number to find the phase of

# Technical Details
# Return Value:	A float value, representing the phase of a complex number
# Python Version:	2.6

# Python None Keyword

# Example
# Assign the value None to a variable:

x = None

print(x)

# Definition and Usage
# The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all.
# None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.

# More Examples
# Example
# If you do a boolean if test, what will happen? Is None True or False:

x = None

if x:
  print("Do you think None is True?")
elif x is False:
  print ("Do you think None is False?")
else:
  print("None is not True, or False, None is just None...")

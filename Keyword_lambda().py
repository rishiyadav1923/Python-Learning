# Python lambda Keyword

# Example
# Create a function that adds 10 to any number you send:

x = lambda a : a + 10

print(x(5))

# Definition and Usage
# The lambda keyword is used to create small anonymous functions.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
# The expression is evaluated and the result is returned.

# More Examples
# Example
# A lambda function with three arguments:

x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c

print(x(5, 6, 2))

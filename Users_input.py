# Python User Input
# User Input
# Python allows for user input.
# That means we are able to ask the user for input.
# The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.
# Python 3.6 uses the input() method.
# Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.
# The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:

# Python 3.6
# username = input("Enter username:")

# print("Username is: " + username)
# Python 2.7
# username = raw_input("Enter username:")
# print("Username is: " + username)
# Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, and continues when the user has given some input.

# Python statistics Module
# Python statistics Module
# Python has a built-in module that you can use to calculate mathematical statistics of numeric data.

# The statistics module was new in Python 3.4.

# Statistics Methods

# Method	                            Description
# statistics.harmonic_mean()	        Calculates the harmonic mean (central location) of the given data
# statistics.mean()  	                Calculates the mean (average) of the given data
# statistics.median()	                Calculates the median (middle value) of the given data
# statistics.median_grouped()	        Calculates the median of grouped continuous data
# statistics.median_high()  	        Calculates the high median of the given data
# statistics.median_low()	            Calculates the low median of the given data
# statistics.mode()	                    Calculates the mode (central tendency) of the given numeric or nominal data
# statistics.pstdev()	                Calculates the standard deviation from an entire population
# statistics.stdev()	                Calculates the standard deviation from a sample of data
# statistics.pvariance()	            Calculates the variance of an entire population
# statistics.variance()	                Calculates the variance from a sample of data

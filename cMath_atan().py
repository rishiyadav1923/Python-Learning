# Python cmath.atan() Method

# Example
# Find the arctangent of a complex number:

#import cmath for complex number operations
import cmath

#find the arc tangent of a complex number
print (cmath.atan(2 + 3j))

# Definition and Usage
# The cmath.atan() method returns the arc tangent of a complex number.
# There are mainly two branch cuts:

# Extending from 1j along the imaginary axis to ∞j towards the right
# Extending from -1j along the imaginary axis to -∞j towards left

# Syntax
# cmath.atan(x)

# Parameter Values
# Parameter	            Description
# x	                    Required. A number to find the arctangent of

# Technical Details
# Return Value:	A complex value, representing arc tangent of a complex number
# Python Version:	2.6

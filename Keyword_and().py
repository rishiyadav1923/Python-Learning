# Python and Keyword

# Example
# Return True if both statements are True:

x = (5 > 3 and 5 < 10)

print(x)

# Definition and Usage
# The and keyword is a logical operator.
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
# The return value will only be True if both statements return True, otherwise it will return False.

# More Examples
# Example
# Using the and keyword in an if statement:

if 5 > 3 and 5 < 10:
  print("Both statements are True")
else:
  print("At least one of the statements are False")

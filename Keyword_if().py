# Python if Keyword

# Example
# Print "YES" if x larger than 3:

x = 5
if x > 3:
  print("YES")

# Definition and Usage
# The if keyword is used to create conditional statements (if statements), and allows you to execute a block of code only if a condition is True.
# Use the else keyword to execute code if the condition is False, see example below.

# More Examples
# Example
# Print "YES" if x is larger than 6, otherwise print "NO":

x = 5
if x > 6:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")

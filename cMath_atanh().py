# Python cmath.atanh() Method

# Example
# Find the hyperbolic arctangent of a complex number:

#import cmath for complex number operations
import cmath

#find the hyperbolic arctangent of a complex number
print (cmath.atanh(2+ 3j))

# Definition and Usage
# The cmath.atanh() method returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of a complex number.
# There are two branch cuts:

# Extends from 1 along the real axis to ∞, continuous from below
# Extends from -1 along the real axis to -∞, continuous from above

# Syntax
# cmath.atanh(x)

# Parameter Values
# Parameter	            Description

# Technical Details
# Return Value:	A complex value, representing inverse hyperbolic tangent of a complex number
# Python Version:	1.5
